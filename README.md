# Data-Structure
<br>
Implementation of most datastructure used such as 
<br>

## Linear Data Structures
<br>
1 - Array
<br>
2 - Stack
<br>
3 - Queue
<br>
4 - Linkedlist
<br>

## Non Linear Data Structures
<br>
- Tree 
<br>
- Graph
<br>
and others of them , the implementation will be with two methods
<br>
1 - array baseed implementation
<br>
2 - linkedlist based implementation
