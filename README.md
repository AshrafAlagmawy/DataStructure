# Data-Structure
<br>
Implementation of most datastructure used such as 

## Linear Data Structures
- Array
- Stack
- Queue
- Linkedlist

## Non Linear Data Structures
- Tree 
- Graph
<br>
and others of them , the implementation will be with two methods
<br>
1 - array baseed implementation
<br>
2 - linkedlist based implementation
